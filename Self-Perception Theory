Self-Perception Theory

      In organizational management, 
      Self-Perception Theory (proposed by Daryl Bem) suggests that-
      people develop their attitudes and feelings by observing their own behavior and the situations in which that behavior occurs.

      Instead of your thoughts driving your actions, this theory says your actions often drive your thoughts.

            ### 🏦 The Banking Analogy: "The Accidental Expert"

            Imagine a junior bank employee named Bappy who doesn't necessarily think of himself as a "leader" or a "high-performer." 
            He just sees himself as someone doing a job.
            
            1. The Behavior: One day, the branch is extremely busy. 
                             Bappy spontaneously starts organizing the queue, helping elderly customers with forms, and showing new interns how to use the software. 
                             He doesn't do this because he feels like a leader; he just does it because the situation demands it.
            2. The Observation: At the end of the day, Bappy sits back and reflects. 
                             He thinks, "Wait, I just spent 4 hours managing people and solving complex problems without being asked."
            3. The New Perception: Because he saw himself acting like a leader, 
                             He concludes: "I must actually be a natural leader and someone who enjoys responsibility."
            
            The Result: His attitude toward his career changes after he sees how he acted.

            ### 🚀 Management Application: The "Fake It 'Til You Make It" Effect
            
            In a bank or any organization, managers use this theory to boost employee morale and performance:

             Behavioral Prompts: A manager might give a shy employee the task of "Greeting VIP Clients."
             Self-Observation: After doing it for a week, the employee thinks, "I'm actually good at talking to people."
             Attitude Change: Their self-confidence increases because they observed their own success.
